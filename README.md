Use of POJO with the help of getters and setters to achieve encapsulation.

Method specific exception handling like SQLException, ServletException, IOException, NullPointerException, ClassNotFoundException etc.
Database used PostgreSQL: connection string and other database credentials settings are defined into datasource file externally.
